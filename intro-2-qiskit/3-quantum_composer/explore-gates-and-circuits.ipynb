Basis states with the same number of zeros (or ones) lie on a shared latitude of the q-sphere (e.g., $|001\\rangle, |010\\rangle, |100\\rangle$). Beginning at the north pole of the q-sphere and progressing southward, each successive latitude has basis states with a greater number of ones; the latitude of a basis state is determined by its [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) from the zero state.

Indeed, like the [phase disk](#phase-disk), the Bloch sphere gives a *local* view of the quantum state, where each qubit is viewed on its own. When trying to understand how registers of qubits (multi-qubit states) behave upon the application of quantum circuits, it is more insightful to take a *global* view and look at the quantum state in its entirety. The q-sphere provides a visual representation of the quantum state, and thus this *global* viewpoint. Therefore, when exploring quantum applications and algorithms on small numbers of qubits, the q-sphere should be the primary visualization method.\n","\n","### Statevector view\n","\n","**6-qubit limit**\n","\n","It is common to call $\\sqrt{p_k}e^{i\\varphi_k}$ the quantum amplitude.
